    "# NBA Player Prediction : 1.41 Modeling\n",

    "This project is an attempt to glean information about NBA Players. When teams invest in a player they are taking a risk. They pay them millions of dollars for the promise of a return on the basketball court and or through marketing/ticket sales. These two are obviously related but that relationship is not one to one. Here I wanted to focus on whether you could predict the future performance of an NBA player based on his statistics in his first two years. I had a number of different theories about what might be interesting and useful. Ultimately I decided that I wanted to see the following **`Can I use a players stats from their first two seasons in the NBA, to predict if they will achieve a benchmark`**. What benchmark? Here I have decided that I am going to try to predict if a player will have a [PER](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/per.html) of over 20 and play over 1000 minutes. Below I will walk through the steps that I used to preprocess the dataframes and prepare for modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have prepared two dataframes. The first is called `second_year_prime` the second dataframe is called `first_second_seasons_agg`. In this notebook I am going to focus on `second_year_prime`. `second_year_prime` is a collection of second year seasons from NBA players dating back to the 2006 season. It only includes players who have played 5 years after their second season (7 year NBA veterans or more). The dataframe has a column called target that contains a `1` if the player will go on to reach the benchmark of higher than 20 PER and over 1200 minutes played and a `0` if the player does not go on to reach that benchmark. I split the dataframe up into training and testing and trained multiple classification models to see how the model can predict if a player reaches the benchmark.\n",
